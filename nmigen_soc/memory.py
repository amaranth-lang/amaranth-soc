class MemoryMap:
    """Memory map.

    A memory map is a hierarchical description of an address space, describing the structure of
    address decoders of peripherals as well as bus bridges. It is built by adding resources
    (range allocations for registers, memory, etc) and windows (range allocations for bus bridges),
    and can be queried later to determine the address of any given resource from a specific
    vantage point in the design.

    Address assignment
    ------------------

    To simplify address assignment, each memory map has an implicit next address, starting at 0.
    If a resource or a window is added without specifying an address explicitly, the implicit next
    address is used. In any case, the implicit next address is set to the address immediately
    following the newly added resource or window.

    Parameters
    ----------
    addr_width : int
        Address width.
    data_width : int
        Data width.
    alignment : log2 of int
        Range alignment. Each added resource and window will be placed at an address that is
        a multiple of ``2 ** alignment``, and its size will be rounded up to be a multiple of
        ``2 ** alignment``.
